# What is This?

This is Sparks Plus!

This is my first real attempt at making a full game and a big part of my goal for is just to learn how Godot works.
I'm keeping the scope pretty small with a simple core concept but with lots of room to exand and add more content as I feel like it.


# Goals

- Use the Godot engine to make game
- Make a fun game
- Release (for free) on Steam
- Get (at least) one positive review from someone who had fun


# The Game

SparksPlus will be a survivor style game, with a core gameplay loop that's pretty similar to others in that genre.
The player will get 2 active abilities that allow them to control "Sparks".  
Instead of unlocking and adding new weapons, there will be a focus on customizing / modifying these sparks to encourage different
styles of play.  
The player will also be able to unlock new "Spark Sources", which are effectively different characters that will have different
initial modifiers or special effects that affect the way Sparks work.  

## Rough Ideas for Game Mechanics

Concept:
- Sparks are generated over time and the player chooses how to use them
- Upgrades that change behavior of sparks allow the player to tweak their playstyle
- game should be very colorful, very simple textures but vibrant colors / lights / partical effects to be visually appealing
- The player earns currency depending on their performance during a run that can be spent outside of runs
- Persistant upgrades / unlockables / new SparkSources allow the player to grow inbetween runs
- Some degree of randomness should be included in enemies / upgrades so that runs feel different 
    - some upgrades could affect rates that upgrades appear, allowing the player to eventually influence fate after a while


The player will have 3 main controls:
- W, A, S, D for movement (controller support?)
- left click to use active ability
- right click to use defensive ability

The player will earn xp from defeating enemies
- level up allows the player to add modifiers to things
- Possible to change behavior of active / defensive ability
- xp is dropped on the ground

The player will earn a currency depending on run performance
- used to unlock new playable characters (Spark Sources)
    - these new characters would look different and potentially have different active / defensive abilities or starting bonuses
- used to purchase persistant upgrades that help the player during runs

There will be several possible "levels" the character can play
- Each has a pre-defined list of possible spawning events and modifiers to use to spawn enemies
    - This is what makes the level unique
    - The player could adjust the difficulty (to get more rewards) which adds extra mods to the level or changes enemy spawn rates
