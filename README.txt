This is Sparks Plus!


Basically, this is the first game I plan to make.  This should be pretty easy to setup, scale up, and make something fun out of

This will be a survivor style game.  
However, instead of weapons, the player will generate "Sparks".  These sparks can then be used to do a bunch of different things.

Concept:
- Sparks are generated over time and the player chooses how to use them
- Upgrades that change behavior of sparks allow the player to tweak their playstyle
- game should be very colorful, very simple textures but vibrant colors / lights / partical effects to be visually appealing
- Persistant upgrades / unlockables allow the player to grow inbetween runs
- Some degree of randomness should be included in enemies / upgrades so that rus feel different 
    - some upgrades could affect rates that upgrades appear, allowing the player to eventually influence fate after a while


The player will have 3 main controls:
- W, A, S, D for movement (controller support?)
- left click to use active ability
- right click to use defensive ability

The player will earn xp from defeating enemies
- level up allows the player to add modifiers to things
- Possible to change behavior of active / defensive ability
- xp is dropped on the ground

The player will earn a currency depending on run performance
- used to unlock new playable characters
    - thes new characters would look different and potentially have different active / defensive abilities or starting bonuses
- used to purchase persistant upgrades
